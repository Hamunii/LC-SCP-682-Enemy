    Sigurd''s danger level: Run


    Im
    not internally sure what this thing is, it looks like some sort of reptile but
    it also seems to have fur.

    for some it has seems as if it was held in the
    facility but when we took the apparatus away it got let loose, it hunted us from
    the inside and didn''t have any mercy towards us, it even talked like a human,
    when we got out somehow this thing enlarged, as if it was adapting, some of my
    foolish crewmates did get some good hits in on it, and it fell, but after a little
    bit of time, it woke back up even angrier, at some point when we where in the
    ship it tried to wait for us to get out, no idea what it is planing, but it is
    very intelligent but also very fierce, If you see this thing i would recommend
    just flying away. -Sigurd'
